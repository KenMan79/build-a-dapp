# Basic Usage Introduction

This is the same usage guide that will be in “Beyond Blockchain: The Futurist Guide to Innovative Technologies” that is available on LeanPub and other places.

One way to get started is by installing the SDK. Let us start by running:

`npm install decentralized-internet`

Now let us:  
```
$ cd node_modules
$ cd decentralized-internet
$ ls
```
Now, multiple folders are setup for routing, but the easiest folder to cd into for looking at the components is addon so:
``
$ cd addon
$ ls
``  
Now you can see there are four main components to this project:

    CluserPost
    GridBee
    LNRChain
    Reinvent the Internet

Those are the core folder/component names of what we will be looking at.
